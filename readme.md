## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

Title: How to setup a local environment(Windows users)

Step 1: Install Docker. Go to this site "https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" and   select your appropriate machine. For instance, if you're an Windows user, then select 
'Docker Desktop for Windows'. 
Step 2: You'll be redirected to a page where you'll find a clickable link, so click it and a file starts downloading. If you're missing some system requirements then do not worry as you'll get to know it on the go.
Step 3: A window pops up which tells you to restart your system in order to download Docker. 
Step 4: After restarting your system, there'll be some downloading process left to be completed, after that open terminal.
Step 5: In the terminal, to verify if the Docker is running type commands 'docker -v' and 'docker-compose -v'.
